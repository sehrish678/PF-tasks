The sun peeked over the horizon,
painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.
Birds chirped cheerfully,
welcoming the new day.
Sarah sat on her porch,
sipping a cup of steaming coffee.
She took a deep breath,
filling her lungs with the crisp morning air,
and smiled as the world woke up around her.
